# Engine Engine
_This is the repository for engineengine development. To make your own engineengine project, see tutorials (_ link pending _)._

### **What is it?**
EngineEngine is an engine to make engines. Recompile crates, or "scraps" at runtime and relink them to create an asynchronously executed web (see SynchronizationGraph _(link pending)_) of user-defined behavior (see RunLoops _(link pending)_). Even concurrent access to shared state can and should be managed through the synchronization graph.

### **How do I develop with Engine?**
If you're interested in jumping into a project then clone the "template" branch, and start creating some submodules (crates/scraps) with `cargo new`.

If you're here because you develop engineengine itself, clone the main branch.
